Predicting race from faces for movie data  
========
Please see the details of the definitions of race, taxonomy of race recognition, database details, neural network models and performance evaluation details in the [wiki page here](https://github.com/usc-sail/mica-race-from-face/wiki)  


## Contents:  

### race labels
